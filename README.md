# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event in which a set of programming puzzles are released each day from December 1st through December 25th. These solutions are written in Deno.

## How to Use

To use these solutions, first clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/MMayla/advent-of-code.git
```

Then, navigate to the directory containing the solution for the year you want to run:

```
cd advent-of-code/[year]
```

Finally, run the solution using Deno:

```
deno run --allow-read ./2022/day1_1.ts
```

## Contents

This repository contains solutions for each day of Advent of Code, organized into directories by year. Each solution is a TypeScript script with the naming pattern `day[day number]_[part number].ts` that can be run as described above.
